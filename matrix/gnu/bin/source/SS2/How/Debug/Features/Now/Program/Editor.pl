# How Do I Make a Perl Program?

# It’s about time you asked (even if you didn’t). Perl programs are text files; you can create
# and edit them with your favorite text editor. (You don’t need any special development
# environment, although there are some commercial ones available from various vendors.
# We’ve never used any of these enough to recommend them.)
